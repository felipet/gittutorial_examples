# Examples from  `felipet/gittutorial`

This repository includes all the examples and proposed exercises from my [**Git Tutorial**](https://felipet.github.io/gittutorial).

The starting point of a particular exercise or example is marked with a tag, whose name is given in the companion tutorial. Checkout a tag, and if it is an exercise, run a script that will prepare the boiler plate code so you can focus on using **Git** rather than writing stupid changes.

```bash
$ ./repo_setup.bash
```

**Have fun!!**
